Hello guys!
I'm a code novice fresh out of college that only had basic C, Python and Matlab programming skills.
Howeverï¼Œ as a mathematics graduate, I am confident in my mathematical foundation and I'm really longing in the math behind the code.
I hope to learn more algorithm knowledge and programming skills on GitHub. I am studying Casadi and IDAS recently, which aim to solve NIP.
Nice to meet you and best wishes for you.
